# Topic Detection and Storage Implementation Checklist

## Core Functionality âœ…
- [x] **Topic Detection**: User messages are analyzed for new topics and side topics
- [x] **Topic Storage**: Detected topics are saved to `topics.md` files in session directories
- [x] **Backlog Display**: Topic backlog is visible in the conversation interface
- [x] **Topic Navigation**: Users can switch between current topic and backlog topics

## Integration âœ…
- [x] **Session Persistence**: Topics survive page reloads and session restarts
- [x] **Conversation Flow**: Topic detection doesn't disrupt the Q&A experience

## Ready for Next Phase ðŸš€
Topic detection and storage implementation complete. Ready to enhance with summarization features.
