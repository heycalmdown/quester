# Contribution Workflow

Follow these rules before making any changes:

1. **Establish the Spec First**
   - Before any coding or modifications, confirm which specification will be worked on.
   - Ask the user to choose or approve the spec focus prior to starting.

2. **Create a Matching Branch**
   - Once the target spec is approved, create a new git branch named after the spec.
   - Do not work from `main`; every task begins on its own branch.

3. **Validate Spec Quality Continuously**
   - During implementation, regularly confirm with the user whether the spec needs refinement.
   - If the spec scope or directory changes, rename the working branch to stay aligned.

4. **Commit Finalized Specs**
   - After the user confirms the spec is complete, commit the current spec state before proceeding with implementation work.

Adhering to this workflow keeps collaboration clear and ensures specs drive every change.
